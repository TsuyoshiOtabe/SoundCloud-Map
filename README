SoundCloud Map displays the latest music uploaded to SoundCloud on a Google Maps map. It features track playback, genre-based filtering and an easy-to-use user interface. It has been implemented by using Python on Google App Engine. The front-end uses jQuery as well as the SoundCloud Javascript Player and Soundmanager 2.

The application has been created by Johan Uhle in the summer term 2009 at Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam / Germany.

A paper about the app, it's functionality and possible extensions has been released here
