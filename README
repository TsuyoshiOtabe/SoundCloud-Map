SoundCloud Map displays the latest music uploaded to SoundCloud on a Google Maps map. It features track playback, genre-based filtering and an easy-to-use user interface. It has been implemented by using Python on Google App Engine. The front-end uses jQuery as well as the SoundCloud Javascript Player and Soundmanager 2.

The application has been created by Johan Uhle in the summer term 2009 at Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam / Germany.

A paper about the app, it's functionality and possible extensions has been released here

The source code has been released on Github here

Installation:

1.) Open a new app on Google App Engine
2.) Get a Google Maps Key for that app url
3.) Include the maps key into settings.py 
4.) Upload to App Engine and let the magic happen

Note: Before any marker are displayed on the map the database cache has to be updated via the cron job. This may take some time depending on the traffic at the SoundCloud server so best is you get yourself something to eat and come back in 20 minutes. Check the logs at your App Engine Admin Dashboard to see, how the backend update is doing.
